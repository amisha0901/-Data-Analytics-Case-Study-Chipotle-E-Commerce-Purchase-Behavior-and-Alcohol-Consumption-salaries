# Data Analytics CaseStudy - Chipotle, E-Commerce-Purchase-Behavior, Alcohol-Consumption, salaries

1)	Analyzed large datasets from Chipotle’s sales, e-commerce transactions, and alcohol consumption patterns
2)	Employed Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering


Technologies Used:-

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization to uncover patterns and trends.

Scikit-learn: For building predictive models (if applicable, e.g., to forecast purchase behavior or sales).

Python: Primary programming language for performing all data analysis tasks.

Key Findings:-

Purchase Behavior Correlations: Identified patterns in how Chipotle’s customers make purchases, such as a tendency for higher order values when alcohol is included.

Time-of-Day Effects: Found correlations between the time of day and the likelihood of alcohol consumption, with higher consumption during evening hours.

Product Pairing Insights: Uncovered popular food-alcohol pairings, leading to recommendations for product bundling in marketing campaigns.

How to Run:-

Clone the repository: git clone <repo_url>.

Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the analysis script: python analysis.py.

Review the output, including visualizations and reports, for insights into consumer behavior.
